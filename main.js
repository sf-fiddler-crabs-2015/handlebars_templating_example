/*
OUR MISSION: We need to get some squirrels from somewheres, and we need to put those squirrels on the page!
*/

// write a function that gets some squirrels with an AJAX call
// when the AJAX call returns, take the squirrels to Uglytown by plopping them into your HTML
// run the getSquirrels function call when the document is ready

// use Handlebars instead to display the squirrels in an awesome way!
